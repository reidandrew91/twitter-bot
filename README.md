# Twitter-Bot

This project uses https://repl.it and https://uptimerobot.com to create a Twitter Bot that is always running. You need these accounts as well as a Twitter account with API access to get started.

The code is set for 1 keyword to search for and retweet, every 5 minutes. It will not retweet the same thing twice.
